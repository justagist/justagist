## About Me

I'm a **Senior Robotics Engineer at Leap AI**, where I lead development of the robot behaviour pipeline and drive software integration for our next-generation warehouse automation platform.

Before Leap, I worked as a **Lead Robotics Research Engineer at Dyson**, focusing on motion planning and control for mobile manipulation robots designed for real-world domestic environments.

I hold a PhD from the **Intelligent Robotics Lab, University of Birmingham**, where my research—*“An Adaptive Framework for
Changing-Contact Robot Manipulation”*—explored hybrid learning-based and classical control approaches for dynamic, contact-rich manipulation tasks.

My primary passion is applying **robotics to real-world problems**, bridging practical engineering with advanced autonomy. At the same time, I have a strong research interest in **intelligent, environment-aware locomanipulation** and the control frameworks that enable it.

## 🔧 What I Enjoy

- Designing and building **robot interfaces** that enable intuitive testing and iteration
- Implementing **intelligent control & planning algorithms** for real robots
- Working with **mobile manipulators** -- real and simulated, especially for assembly and complex interaction tasks
- Exploring new **tools, languages, and ideas**—and hacking on them in my own way
