<h4 markdown="1">About Me</h4>

I currently work as a Senior Robotics Research Engineer at Dyson, mainly working on control and planning for mobile manipulation robots intended for helping in domestic tasks and environments.

Previously, I was a PhD student in the Intelligent Robotics Lab at the University of Birmingham, working on **"Machine Learing for Dexterous Robot Manipulation"**. The main area of my research was applying Machine Learning techniques to develop a framework that can aid robots to perform changing-contact manipulation tasks in dynamic and unknown environments using different objects.

<h4 markdown="1">My Interests</h4>

- I like creating robot interfaces and implementing algorithms for testing the capabilities of intelligent robot systems.
- I especially enjoy working with mobile robots and manipulators in the context of assembly tasks involving challenging interaction dynamics and complex control strategies.
- I also like discovering things (codes, algorithms, languages, music, etc.) and trying them out in my own way.
